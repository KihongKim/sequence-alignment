ABSTRACT

Sequence alignment, also known as optimal matching, has recently received a new attention for activity pattern analysis. The method is almost always combined with a data reduction technique, such as clustering analysis. It turns out that the cluster-based approach is powerful for discovering a typology of people’s activity patterns. However, the methodological combination of sequence alignment and cluster analysis does not seem successful in identifying diverse factors that would affect activity sequence patterns. This is because too much information loss may occur as the set of activity sequences is reduced to a small number of clusters. Instead of the cluster-based approach, this paper proposes a new methodological combination of sequence alignment with discrepancy analysis. As a generalization of the principle of ANOVA, discrepancy analysis allows us to evaluate the association between activity sequences characterized by a pairwise distance matrix and one or more covariates. Additionally, an induction tree is built to complement the sequence discrepancy analysis by displaying how individual activity sequences vary with the value of covariates.
